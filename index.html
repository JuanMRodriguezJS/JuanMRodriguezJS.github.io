        <h2>About Juan M. Rodriguez</h2>
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Juan M. Rodriguez and I’m a student currently studying software engineering. I’m passionate about technology and love learning how to build and code my own websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student, I’ve had the opportunity to learn about a wide range of technologies and programming languages. I’m constantly seeking out new challenges and enjoy pushing myself to improve my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, you can often find me tinkering with code and experimenting with new web design ideas. I love the creative freedom that comes with building my own websites and find it incredibly rewarding to see my ideas come to life on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading, and spending time with friends and family. I’m also an aspiring home cook that loves learning new recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. If you’d like to connect or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out. I’d love to hear from you!
